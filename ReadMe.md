# Drone collector

This app is used to receive data from drone and store it into database.

## How to run

Launch the script "./compile.sh" while in this folder (the "drone_data_collector" one)
and run the application created in the "build folder".

If the script doesn't work for any reason, you can compile yourself by typing :

```
$ sudo mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
